## Drizzle ORM
I did speak to some people who are typescript developers and discussed the best and most simple ORM, i landed on Drizzle.
To integrate drizzle in the project i used the nestjs-drizzle module.

## Database design
If more time i would do a N(3) layout focused on code/clean domain model.
I selected PostgreSQL as database as i am familiar with that and it works well containerized.

## Github Pages
I do not have any experience with github pages and it seems to be complicated to connect your own rest api.
I will host the repo on github but i will most likely host the project on a different platform.
